1. Browser Input Processing:
• The browser first parses the URL to identify the protocol (HTTPS) and domain name (google.com)
• It checks its local cache to see if there's a recent DNS resolution for google.com

2. DNS Resolution:
• If not in cache, your browser initiates a DNS lookup
• Your computer checks its local DNS cache first
• If not found, it queries your configured DNS resolver (usually your ISP's DNS server)
• The DNS query travels through the DNS hierarchy:
  • Root nameservers
  • .com TLD nameservers
  • Google's authoritative nameservers
• The DNS server returns the IP address for google.com

3. TCP Connection:
• Browser initiates a TCP connection with the returned IP address
• TCP three-way handshake occurs:
  • Client sends SYN packet
  • Server responds with SYN-ACK
  • Client sends ACK
• TCP connection is now established

4. TLS/SSL Handshake (because it's HTTPS):
• Client sends "Client Hello" with supported cipher suites
• Server responds with "Server Hello", chosen cipher suite, and certificate
• Certificate validation occurs
• Key exchange happens
• Symmetric encryption keys are established
• Secure channel is ready

5. HTTP Request:
• Browser sends HTTP GET request over the secure channel
• Request includes:
  • Headers (User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, etc.)
  • Any cached data validation (If-Modified-Since, etc.)

6. Server Processing:
• Google's servers receive the request
• Load balancers distribute the request
• Web servers process the request
• Application servers generate the response
• Database queries may occur if needed

7. Response Journey:
• Server sends back HTTP response
• Response includes:
  • Status code (usually 200 OK)
  • Headers
  • HTML content
  • References to additional resources (CSS, JavaScript, images)

8. Browser Processing:
• Browser receives the initial HTML
• Begins parsing the HTML document
• Creates DOM (Document Object Model)
• Discovers additional required resources

9. Additional Resource Fetching:
• Browser makes parallel requests for:
  • CSS files
  • JavaScript files
  • Images
  • Fonts
  • Other media
• Each resource goes through its own TCP/TLS connection process

10. Page Rendering:
• Constructs CSSOM (CSS Object Model)
• Combines DOM and CSSOM to create render tree
• Calculates layout (reflow)
• Paints elements to the screen
• Executes JavaScript

11. Post-Loading:
• Browser caches resources for future visits
• Continues executing any asynchronous JavaScript
• Handles user interactions
• Maintains the TCP connection for a while (keep-alive)

Throughout this entire process, multiple layers of hardware are involved:
• Your local machine's CPU, memory, and network interface
• Network equipment (routers, switches)
• ISP infrastructure
• Internet backbone
• Google's edge servers and CDNs
• Google's data center hardware

The software stack includes:
• Browser's networking stack
• Operating system's TCP/IP stack
• DNS resolver libraries
• TLS/SSL libraries
• HTML/CSS parsers
• JavaScript engines
• Rendering engines

This entire process typically happens in a fraction of a second, showcasing the remarkable efficiency of modern web 
infrastructure.


I'll explain the lower-level networking details that occur after DNS resolution, focusing on Layer 3 (Network) and below: [1]

1. Layer 2 (Data Link) and Layer 1 (Physical) Initial Steps:
• Your computer needs to send packets to the destination IP, but first needs to leave your local network
• Network Interface Card (NIC) operations:
  • NIC driver initializes the hardware
  • Checks if interface is up and has IP configuration
  • Verifies MAC address is properly assigned

2. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Process:
• Computer checks its routing table to determine next hop
• For packets destined outside local network, default gateway IP is used
• ARP resolution begins:
  • Computer checks ARP cache for gateway's MAC address
  • If not found, broadcasts ARP request: "Who has IP x.x.x.x?"
  • Gateway responds with its MAC address
  • ARP cache is updated with the mapping

3. Frame Creation and Physical Transmission:
• Ethernet frame is created with:
  • Source MAC (your NIC)
  • Destination MAC (gateway)
  • EtherType (0x0800 for IPv4)
  • IP packet as payload
• NIC operations:
  • Frame is encoded into electrical signals
  • CSMA/CD checks for channel availability
  • Physical transmission over the medium (copper/fiber)

4. Local Network to Gateway:
• Frame travels through local network infrastructure:
  • Network switches learn MAC addresses
  • Switches forward frame based on MAC address table
  • Frame arrives at gateway router

5. Router Processing:
• Router receives frame and processes it:
  • Strips off Ethernet header
  • Checks IP header for destination
  • Decrements TTL
  • Recalculates IP header checksum
  • Consults routing table for next hop

6. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Internet Routing:
• Packets traverse multiple autonomous systems (AS)
• BGP routers exchange routing information:
  • AS path information
  • Network reachability
  • Policy-based routing decisions
• Route selection process:
  • Shortest AS path
  • Lowest origin type
  • Lowest MED value
  • External over internal paths
  • Lowest router ID

7. Internet Backbone Transit:
• Traffic flows through major internet exchanges
• Multiple redundant paths available
• MPLS labels might be used for traffic engineering
• QoS policies may be applied
• Traffic may cross submarine cables for international destinations

8. Layer 2 Operations at Each Hop:
• At each router hop:
  • New ARP resolution for next hop
  • New Ethernet frame creation
  • MAC address rewriting
  • Error checking (CRC)

9. Last Mile Delivery:
• Packet reaches destination network's edge router
• Final BGP router determines local delivery
• Packet routed to specific datacenter
• Load balancer receives the packet

10. Physical Layer Considerations:
• Different physical media types:
  • Copper (ethernet)
  • Fiber optic
  • Wireless
• Signal processing:
  • Encoding/decoding
  • Error correction
  • Clock recovery
  • Signal amplification

11. Error Handling and Reliability:
• CRC checks at Layer 2
• IP header checksum verification
• TCP sequence number tracking
• Packet fragmentation and reassembly if needed
• Congestion control mechanisms

12. Quality of Service (QoS):
• DSCP markings in IP header
• Traffic prioritization
• Bandwidth allocation
• Queue management
• Congestion avoidance

This process happens for each packet in the communication, with modern networks handling millions of such transactions per 
second. The robustness of these protocols and their interaction ensures reliable communication even when individual 
components fail.

The beauty of this system is its modularity - each layer handles its specific responsibilities while being agnostic to the 
details of other layers, following the principles of the OSI model.
